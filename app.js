/*
  CHALLENGE 1 - Greatest Common Divisor
  ------------------------------------- 
  Given two positive integers, a and b, write a function that 
  returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The GCD is defined 
  as the largest positive integer that divides both a and b 
  without leaving a remainder

  Example - GCD of 12 & 18 is 3
*/

function findGCD(a, b) {

  // HINTS:
  // what happens if one number (a or b) is 0?
  // try using recursion

}
