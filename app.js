// CHALLENGES

// don't be afraid of getting things wrong
//   --> you learn by making mistakes

// think about efficiency and time complexity
//   --> test for different inputs (large & small)

// use the techniques we've learnt in this course
//   --> recursion, sliding windows, freq counting, pointers etc

// give every challenge a good go
//   --> this is where the real learning starts
