/*
  CHALLENGE 4 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  ------------------------------------- 
  Given a string, str, write a function to find the length of the longest substring that contains only unique characters (no repeating characters)

  Example: "pbbabcbcbb" --> 3 (abc)
*/

function lengthOfLongestSubstring(str) {
  // use a sliding window to track the current substring
  
  // keep track of the last seen index of each character

  // keep track of the starting position of the window
  
  // update the max length as you move the window along
}
